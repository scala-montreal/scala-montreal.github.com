### {{ page.title }}

On August 1st, Wajam, a social search startup, invited the Scala enthusiasts in Montreal. André-Philippe and Félix presented two Scala frameworks called [NRV](https://github.com/wajam/nrv) and [MRY](https://github.com/wajam/mry) that the Wajam team has been developing to address the startup scaling needs. Then, Guillaume Massé showed [ScalaKata](http://www.scalakata.com/), a web application that allows Scala developers to write, eval and share Scala code.
