## Installation

	rake theme:install git="https://github.com/dhulihan/hooligan.git" 

## Preview

You can preview this theme at the [Jekyll-Bootstrap Theme Gallery](http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com/preview/hooligan/).

## Extra Stuff
 
This theme has some optional configuration support for social buttons. Just add your provider and username to `_config.yml`, like so:

	author :
	  name : John Doe
	  email : blah@email.test 
	  github : johndoe
	  twitter : dhulihan
	  feedburner : johndoe
	  googleplus: johndoe
	  # Whatever you specify for the linkedin option will be placed after `www.linkedin.com/in/`
	  linkedin: johndoe

Icons with links to your profiles will then appear on the navbar. Your stalkers will *love* you for making things so easy!
